The acronym stands for Avtomat Nikonova (after Gennadiy Nikonov) Model 1994, and it was chosen over many other competing firearms in an extensive trial, including the AEK-971 design by a team led by the son of AK-47 designer Mikhail Kalashnikov, Sergey Koksharov. The AN-94 was designed at the Izhmash state factories, as a replacement for the AK-74 assault rifle currently in use in the Russian military. Currently, the Russian military is retaining the AK-74M as its standard shoulder arm and the AN-94 is only being issued to the elite forces of the Russian military, some Russian police forces, and the MVD.";
