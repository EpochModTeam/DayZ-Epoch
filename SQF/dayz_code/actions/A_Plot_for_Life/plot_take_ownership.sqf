// Plot Take Ownership by RimBlock (http://epochmod.com/forum/index.php?/user/12612-rimblock/)
//
// This script allows Plot pole owners to take ownership of all allowed buildables on their plot except lockable storage and tents.
//
// Note:
// This code calls server_publishFullObject which also saves damage, inventory and fuel.  Hitpoints are assumed to be empty as this is for buildables only.
